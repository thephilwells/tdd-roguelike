# Rendering A Box

## Picking Up Where We Left Off

The `<Text>` field we created in chapter 002 will need to go, in favor of a two-dimensional space. Ink has us covered with a component called `<Box>`. In Ink versions 3+, these `Box` elements can be styled with borders and layouts using an API similar to flex boxes in CSS. I love this! It makes it pretty easy to reason about the layout and appearance of each frane we're rendering in our app. We'll use this kind of styling today in a new title card component.

## Components in Components

One of the nice things about React is its ability to compose large views and applications out of smaller, modular, reuasable components. Rather than just print the title from state onto our top-level `App` component, we're going to create an `Arena` component about the same size as the overall `App`, inside of which we're going to count one of a list of view types, whether they be gameplay view, character info view, Game Over view, or our `TitleCard`.

Ah, but we're testing first, right? We know that by the end of this we want to have rendered our application with the `TitleCard` visible. So, we're going to write a test that confirms that the last frame looks the way we want our title card to look. For the record, here's what the title card will look like when rendered by our app:

One nice thing about text-based applications and games is that expected views like this are easy to recreate non-programmatically with pixel-perfect accuracy, compared to web-like designs where every tiny pixel matters. We could make the screenshot above in a text editor, if we want to, and have a legitimate design for a real screen in our app. (In fact, I made the design for that screen in an ASCII-editing application called [Monodraw](https://monodraw.helftone.com/))

So we have a visual design, laid out in text. How do we tell Jest that that's what we expect the screen to look like? Is it possible, in TDD fashion, to write this expectation before our application is even capable of rendering the actual view?

Yes, it is possible, through the magic of Jest snapshot testing!

## Jest Snapshots

Let's work on our test. We can overwrite the existing test which checks for the output of our original `Text` component, since that will be replace by this new output.

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'ink-testing-library'
import { App } from '../App'

describe('APP', () => {
  it('returns the name of the game', () => {
    // Arrange
    const { lastFrame } = render(<App />)

    // Assert
    expect(lastFrame()).toMatchSnapshot()
  })
})
```

Notice that we have added a new assertion method to the end of our expectation: `toMatchSnapshot()`. This Jest function compares the actual value passed to `expect()` to a special file in a nearby subfolder called `__snapshots__` (this subfolder will be automatically generated by Jest the first time this test is run.) Here's what a snapshot file looks like:

```javascript
// App.test.js.snap
// Jest Snapshot v1, https://goo.gl/fbAQLP

exports[`APP returns the name of the game 1`] = `

We can plug our ASCII design directly into a Jest snapshot file and run our tests, comparing the program output directly to our designs! This is novel to Ink and terminal-based programs. To get this kind of visual integrity checking in a true web app, we'd have to use a visual screenshot diffing algorithm and triage the results. Text for the win!

[Here's the full documentation on Jest snapshots.](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing)

(Note also that in the docs they say you probably shouldn't use snapshot testing in TDD, since writing the snapshot files manually is not approachable, but OH WELL)

So now we have a failing test. Excellent! Let's make it pass.

## Enter the Arena

Since I want my `App` to be used as an entry point for state, a top-level wrapper, I'm going to move the actual "thing that renders other things within it" down a level. This container for composition will be called the `Arena`. The double-line border seen around the design is actually the outline of this outer box, and the plan will be to switch subcomponents, like the `TitleCard`, into this. So, let's put together this `Arena` with some reasonable defaults:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { render, Text, Box } from 'ink'
import { TitleCard } from './TitleCard'

export const Arena = (props) => {
  let [gameState, updateGameState] = useState(props)
  return (
    <Box
      width={80}
      height={45}
      borderStyle="double"
      display="flex"
    >
      <TitleCard {...gameState}/>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

Here again we're setting up state for the component. In this case it's based on props passed in from the parent `App` component.

There are a few ways to share state around to all the components nested within a React application. One way, as you can see here, is to declare some state at a high level and pass it downstream as `props` to the child components that will need that state to render stuff. In a simple world where we have an app simply passing a string down a couple levels to a `TitleCard`, this is fine. In theory if we needed to accept actions in a downstream app like the `TitleCard` (say, accepting input to clear it away) we'd also pass as props some references to functions like `onKeyPress()` so the actions could come back upstream and run those functions at the top level. Right now this app is all simple enough that this is fine. As the game becomes more complex, this is going to get unwieldy. We'll look at another way to handle this in the next section, and we'll be glad to have a test in place when we're refactoring!

Now we'll set up our `TitleCard` component:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import { render, Text, Box } from 'ink'

export const TitleCard = (props) => {
  let [state, setSate] = useState(props)
  return (
    <Box flexDirection="column" width="100%" justifyContent="space-around">
      <Box height="85%" alignItems="center" justifyContent="center">
        <Text>{state.title}</Text>
      </Box>
      <Box height="15%" alignItems="center" justifyContent="center">
        <Text>[Press any key to start...]</Text>
      </Box>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

Here's the actual rendering. You can see how we pas the props yet again down to this component to get that `title` value that we set all the way up in our top-level `App`.

You might also notice some familiar-looking style qualifiers in our Ink elements. This is the flexbox-like API in action. By using familiar CSS-like terminology we're able to place our `<Text>` elements where we want them within their parent `<Box>` elements, resulting in a web-like layout on our terminal. When we run this, the output should match out Jest snapshot, and the test should pass!

## Looking Forward

This still doesn't seem very game-y yet, I know. Next time we're going to monkey with React Context and custom hooks to make accessing game state easier before we balloon out the functionality. After that, we'll try to cycle between game states. Then hopefully, finally, we'll get cracking on an event loop and - *GASP* - moving a little `@` around the screen!
