## Context in React

Right now we've set the title of our game at the root of the tree that is our little sapling application. This little tidbit of data is then passed up through a container component called `Arena`, where it does nothing except get passed outward again to our `TitleCard` component. If `Arena` isn't doing anything with the data, then why should we have to pass it into that component? 

There is a way to skip the `Arena` component. We can take advantage of a React concept known as Context. By creating a context provider at the root of our app, we can install context consumers out in the downstream components to pick up data from the root, without having to receive it as props from its immediate parent component.

In this installment we'll use context to get the title data into our `TitleCard` using context without passing it through `Arena`. Once we have that running, we'll clean it up by abstracting it all into a custom hook.

This seems like gilding the lily at this point, with one one little chunk of data being passed around, but game state is going to be pretty complex. As we get into deeper development we'll be glad we don't have a lot of pass-only bloat in our in-between components.

### Adding Context

Let's rewrite our single test to load the app with a context provider:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { render } from "ink-testing-library";
import { App, GameContext } from "../App";

describe("APP", () => {
  it("returns the name of the game", () => {
    // Arrange
    const { lastFrame } = render(
      <GameContext.Provider value={{ title: "TDD Roguelike!" }}>
        <App />
      </GameContext.Provider>
    );

    // Assert
    expect(lastFrame()).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

This a big change! Let's walk through it. First, we have a new import; we're going to use something called `GameContext` that's being exported from `App.js`. This specialized component thingy is a part of the React API: it's a context provider.

Objects added to the `value` of this provider will be accessible by other components in the wrapped app. Here we're passing in a simple object for `value`, one with a value for `title`. We'll need to make some updates to the `App` component itself and to its grandchild `TitleCard` component to consume the app's context.

Here's the `App` component:

```javascript
import React, { createContext } from 'react'
import { render, Text } from 'ink'
import { Arena } from './components/Arena'

export const GameContext = createContext()

export const App = () => {
  return <Arena />
}

const defaultState = {
  title: 'TDD Roguelike!'
}

render(
  <GameContext.Provider value={defaultState}>
    <App />
  </GameContext.Provider>,
  {patchConsole: false}
)
```

This gives us a pretty clear picture of how the Context API works. We export a new object called `GameContext`, which is created using React's `createContext()` method. `GameContext` itself will have a couple of important tools, a `Provider` and a `Consumer`. The `Provider` is the special component we use to wrap our application. With the `App` component thusly wrapped, it and all its subcomponents will be able to use `GameContext.Consumer` to access data in that context. 

Let's see how we're accessing the context in `TitleCard`:

```javascript
import React, { useContext } from 'react'
import { GameContext } from '../App'
import { render, Text, Box } from 'ink'

export const TitleCard = () => {
  const state = useContext(GameContext)
  return (
    <Box flexDirection="column" width="100%" justifyContent="space-around">
      <Box height="85%" alignItems="center" justifyContent="center">
        <Text>{state.title}</Text>
      </Box>
      <Box height="15%" alignItems="center" justifyContent="center">
        <Text>[Press any key to start...]</Text>
      </Box>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

React provides a `useContext()` hook that we can use to tap into any contexts we've set up. Here, we import `GameContext` and pass it into the hook; it outputs the `value` we gave it, which we save in this component as `state`.

And that's it! Now that we don't need to pass the state as props through the in-between `Arena` component, let's clean that up as well:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { render, Text, Box } from 'ink'
import { TitleCard } from './titlecard'

export const Arena = () => {
  return (
    <Box
      width={80}
      height={45}
      borderStyle="double"
      display="flex"
    >
      <TitleCard />
    </Box>
  )
}
```

In `Arena` we remove `useState`, we don't accept `props` as an argument, and we don't pass anything into the `TitleCard` component. Much cleaner!

Our snapshot test should pass now, confirming that stater is making it from `GameContext` down into the `TitleCard` for rendering.

### A Custom Component For Game Context

We've made it much nicer to pass data from the root of our app out to its outermost components, but there's a catch. In its current form, the values in context are immutable. We removed `setState` from the root, after all. We need to do a little extra work to be able to accept input and change the state of the game. For this we need to create a stateful component to render our context provider. Let's create a custom component that has its own state to wrap `App`, instead of just wrapping it with the contexct provider.

We'll make a new file called `StateContext.js`:

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState } from "react";

const GameContext = createContext();

const defaultState = {
  title: "TDD Roguelike!"
};

export default function StateProvider({ children }) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(defaultState);

  return (
    <GameContext.Provider value={{ state, setState }}>
      {children}
    </GameContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

Just like the bare context provider we set up before in `App`, this takes a `value`, and here we set that to be the `state` we create using the `useState` hook.

With this in place we can simplify our `App` component:

```javascript
import React, { createContext } from 'react'
import StateProvider from './StateContext'
import { render, Text } from 'ink'
import { Arena } from './components/Arena'

export const App = () => {
  return <Arena />
}

render(
  <StateProvider>
    <App />
  </StateProvider>,
  {patchConsole: false}
)
```

And it will render our game all the same.

It's probably not the best practice to just let any component down the line mutate state however it sees fit. Rather, we'll want to expose a limited set of methods to change the state (even though at this point we're not even accepting user input.) Here's how that's going to look:

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState } from "react";

const GameContext = createContext();

const defaultState = {
  title: "TDD Roguelike!"
};

export default function StateProvider({ children }) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(defaultState);

  const setScreen = (screen) => {
    setState({
      ...state,
      screen
    })
  }

  return (
    <GameContext.Provider value={{ state, setScreen }}>
      {children}
    </GameContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

By passing `setScreen` instead of `setState` we allow any context consumers in the app to change the value for `screen` in our game state, by using a specialized setter.

This is looking fine, but there's one more change we're going to make to put all this context stuff into a magical custom hook.

### A Custom Hook For Game State

Let's change the name of `StateContext.js` to `game-hooks.js` and make a few additions:

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from "react";

const GameContext = createContext();
export const useGameContext = () => useContext(GameContext); // <-- new!

// ...
```

By exporting this simple `useGameContext` method, we turn our encapsulated context module into a full-blown hook, usable by components to directly affect game state. Let's look at how this plays out in the rest of the app. `App.js` still uses the custom `StateProvider`. Let's update our test to reflect the new wrapping component:

```javascript
// App.test.js
import React from "react";
import { render } from "ink-testing-library";
import StateProvider from '../game-hooks'
import { App } from "../App";

describe("APP", () => {
  it("returns the name of the game", () => {
    // Arrange
    const { lastFrame } = render(
      <StateProvider>
        <App />
     </StateProvider>
    );

    // Assert
    expect(lastFrame()).toMatchSnapshot();
  });
});
```

And finally let's leverage our new custom hook in the `TitleCard` component:

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { useGameContext } from '../game-hooks'
import { render, Text, Box } from 'ink'

export const TitleCard = () => {
  const { state } = useGameContext() // <-- nice!
  return (
    <Box flexDirection="column" width="100%" justifyContent="space-around">
      <Box height="85%" alignItems="center" justifyContent="center">
        <Text>{state.title}</Text>
      </Box>
      <Box height="15%" alignItems="center" justifyContent="center">
        <Text>[Press any key to start...]</Text>
      </Box>
    </Box>
  )
}
```

Less imports, more power. We're not changing state yet, but once we get into managing user inputs, we'll be able to access methods that affect our game state, and we can sort of hide all the logic behind our state provider. This separation of components, where we'll serve our game's view, and our application's state, is going to pay huge dividends as this project gets more complex.

And, of course, our test should still be passing at this point.

Next up: accepting user input!
